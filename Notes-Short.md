OOP's with C++
--------------

POP -- procedure oriented programming
OOP -- object oriented programming 

OOP -- data will be epicenter of focus(section)--then procedure(section).
POP -- we should/will focus on procedure

OOP -- polymorphism & inheritance is present
POP -- polymorphism & inheritance is absent

C++ supports re-usablility		[achieves abstraction but not as much Java]
C doesn't...


/* RGY's story */
Summary:
C was lacking in it's performance!! C++ was born!

C with classes == C++

internet was created as a bi-product of JAVA!!

C compiler cannot compile C++ codes whereas C++ compiler can do so for C codes.

CLASS & OBJECTS
CONSTRUCTORS & DESTRUCTORS
MEMBER FUNCTIONS			[functions are also known METHODS]
DATA MEMBER
NON MEMBER DATA
NON MEMBER FUNCTION
FRIEND FUNC.(S)
OPERATOR OVERLOADING
FUNCTION OVERLOADING
GENERIC FUNC.(S)
GENERIC CLASSES

polymorphism -----a) static b) dynamic

C++ allows to have more than one function to have same name that either differs in the number of parameters or in the types of parameters.
Signature of a fn. --no. of parameters, types of parameters and name of function(s).
function overloading -- BLA-BLA!
Candidate functions & Viable functions

Structures of C are Classes in C++ but has wide features.

>>DAY-2

In c, struct members are by default are public
In c++,  ----------------------ii- are private

In both C and c++, (.) is known as 'period' operator

Private is for DATA SECURITY..

function instantiation

>>DAY-3

dynamic memory allocation -- new
------------------ii----- is always allocated in heap mem.

pointer always holds addresses -- so 4 bytes(**always)

de-allocation of dynamically allocated mem -- delete

constructors & destructors
friend functions

getters nd setters

inheritance: superclass/baseclass
		childclass/subclass

Virtual functions

>>DAY-4

Virtual functions

function overloading v/s overriding

[this->] signature differs..

>>DAY-5

opperator;
fn overriding
dynamic polymorphism
