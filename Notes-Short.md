OOP's with C++<br />
--------------<br />

POP -- procedure oriented programming<br />
OOP -- object oriented programming <br />

OOP -- data will be epicenter of focus(section)--then procedure(section).<br />
POP -- we should/will focus on procedure<br />

OOP -- polymorphism & inheritance is present<br />
POP -- polymorphism & inheritance is absent<br />

C++ supports re-usablility		[achieves abstraction but not as much Java]<br />
C doesn't...<br />
<br />

/* RGY's story */<br />
Summary:<br />
C was lacking in it's performance!! C++ was born!<br />

C with classes == C++<br />

internet was created as a bi-product of JAVA!!<br />

C compiler cannot compile C++ codes whereas C++ compiler can do so for C codes.<br />

CLASS & OBJECTS<br />
CONSTRUCTORS & DESTRUCTORS<br />
MEMBER FUNCTIONS			[functions are also known METHODS]<br />
DATA MEMBER<br />
NON MEMBER DATA<br />
NON MEMBER FUNCTION<br />
FRIEND FUNC.(S)<br />
OPERATOR OVERLOADING<br />
FUNCTION OVERLOADING<br />
GENERIC FUNC.(S)<br />
GENERIC CLASSES<br />

polymorphism -----a) static b) dynamic<br />

C++ allows to have more than one function to have same name that either differs in the number of parameters or in the types of parameters.<br />
Signature of a fn. --no. of parameters, types of parameters and name of function(s).<br />
function overloading -- BLA-BLA!<br />
Candidate functions & Viable functions<br />

Structures of C are Classes in C++ but has wide features.<br />

>>DAY-2

In c, struct members are by default are public
In c++,  ----------------------ii- are private

In both C and c++, (.) is known as 'period' operator

Private is for DATA SECURITY..

function instantiation

>>DAY-3

dynamic memory allocation -- new<br />
------------------ii----- is always allocated in heap mem.<br />

pointer always holds addresses -- so 4 bytes(**always)<br />

de-allocation of dynamically allocated mem -- delete<br />

constructors & destructors<br />
friend functions<br />

getters and setters<br />

inheritance: superclass/baseclass<br />
		childclass/subclass<br />

Virtual functions<br />

>>DAY-4

Virtual functions<br />

function overloading v/s overriding<br />

[this->] signature differs..<br />

>>DAY-5

opperator;<br />
fn overriding<br />
dynamic polymorphism<br />
---------------THE END---------------
